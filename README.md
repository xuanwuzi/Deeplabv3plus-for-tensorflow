# Deeplabv3plus-for-tensorflow
The project is developedv3plus using TensorFlow 2.10.

This project is based on Python 3.8 environment, and the necessary libraries include tensoflow 2.10.

Project purpose:

1. Realize semantic segmentation of any image based on developedv3plus (2 categories).

Steps:

1. After preparing the sample data set, run data_progress.py to randomly divide the sample data set into training set, validation set, and test set;

2. Run train.py to train the model;

3. Run predict.py to predict on the test set (it can also predict for new data);

4. Run calculate.py to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
